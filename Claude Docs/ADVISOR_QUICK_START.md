Late registration runs from December 1-7 with a $50 late fee.

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Use Specific Questions

**Good:** "Show me students with GPA below 2.5"
**Less Specific:** "Show me bad students"

The AI understands natural language, but specific numbers and criteria give better results!

### 2. You Can Ask Follow-Up Questions

The AI remembers your conversation, so you can ask follow-up questions:

```
You: "Show me honor students"
AI: [Lists honor students]

You: "When did I last talk to Sarah Johnson?"
AI: [Shows last contact with Sarah]
```

### 3. Partial Names Work!

You don't need to remember full names:

```
"When did I last talk to Smith?"  ← Finds any student with "Smith" in name
"Show last contact with Sarah"  ← Fuzzy matches
```

### 4. Combine Different Queries

You can ask both advisor questions AND general questions in the same conversation:

```
"Where is the computer lab?"  ← General university question
"Show me my students"  ← Advisor-specific question
```

### 5. Use the AI for Planning

**Morning Routine:**
1. "Show me all my students" - Get overview
2. "Show students with GPA below 2.5" - Identify who needs help
3. "List students I haven't contacted recently" - Follow up needed

**Before Advisory Meetings:**
1. "When did I last talk to [student name]?" - Check contact history
2. "Show me [student name]'s academic info" - Review performance

**Monthly Reviews:**
1. "Show honor students" - Recognize achievements
2. "Find at-risk students" - Plan interventions

## Troubleshooting

### "No students found"

**Possible Causes:**
- You might not have students assigned yet
- Database might not be populated

**Solution:**
- Contact your system administrator
- Verify you logged in as an advisor

### "Function not available"

**Possible Causes:**
- You logged in as a student account (students can't access advisor functions)

**Solution:**
- Make sure you logged in with an advisor email (e.g., advisor.l1.1@mentorlink.com)

### "Student not found"

**Possible Causes:**
- Student name spelled incorrectly
- Student not assigned to you

**Solution:**
- Try partial name: "Smith" instead of "John Smith"
- Use "Show me all my students" to see full list

### AI gives unexpected answer

**Possible Causes:**
- Question might be ambiguous
- AI might not have a specific function for that query

**Solution:**
- Rephrase your question more specifically
- Try breaking complex questions into smaller parts

### Chat is slow

**Possible Causes:**
- Complex queries with large datasets
- Server load

**Solution:**
- Most queries should respond in under 2 seconds
- If consistently slow, contact technical support

---

## Understanding Response Categories

### Honor Student Categories

When you ask for honor students, they're grouped into three categories:

**Highest Honors (Summa Cum Laude)**
- GPA: 3.90 - 4.00
- Top academic achievement

**High Honors (Magna Cum Laude)**
- GPA: 3.75 - 3.89
- Excellent academic performance

**Honors (Cum Laude)**
- GPA: 3.50 - 3.74
- Very good academic performance

### Contact Types

When checking last contact, you'll see one of two types:

**Advisor-Student Conversation**
- Direct message between you and the student
- More personal interaction

**AI Chat Session**
- Student used the AI assistant
- Indicates student sought information but didn't contact you directly
- Might be a good opportunity to reach out personally
